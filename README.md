# rust_miscellaneous_pkg

A collection of useful functionalities 

Main target is to link it to other languages like R or Node.js

For the Bio Algorithms the package [rust-bio](https://github.com/rust-bio/rust-bio) is used.

Therefore I will cite the follwing article:

[KÃ¶ster, J. (2016). Rust-Bio: a fast and safe bioinformatics library. Bioinformatics, 32(3), 444-446.](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/3/444/1743419)
